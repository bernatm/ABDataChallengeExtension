## Abstract
This research aims to use machine learning algorithms to predict future water use after
analysing water data usage in Barcelona from 2019 to 2021. This study will use geo-temporal
data to evaluate consumption trends in several areas and time durations. The main goal is
to identify and group trends of users thorugh k-Means clustering and use Shapley values to
evaluate the relationships between consumption statistics and parameters like household
income, weather, and population density. Also, the research will assess how well the ARIMA
model can estimate water use trends and provides a comparative analysis with other models
such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, Prophet Model or Gradient Boosting
Regression Trees (GBRT). My study has delivered findings that suggest how Barcelonaâ€™s
water resources might be handled more effectively and can be applied to other cities with
the corresponding adaptations.
